Building
========

Linux
=====

The host system must be 64-bit. A Python 3.5+ interpreter must be
available. The execution environment must have access to a Docker
daemon (all build operations are performed in Docker containers for
isolation from the host system).

To build a Python distribution for Linux x64::

    $ ./build-linux.py
    # With profile-guided optimizations (generated code should be faster):
    $ ./build-linux.py --optimizations pgo
    # Produce a debug build.
    $ ./build-linux.py --optimizations debug

You can also build another version of Python. e.g.::

    $ ./build-linux.py --python cpython-3.8

To build a Python distribution for Linux x64 using musl libc::

    $ ./build-linux.py --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

Building a 32-bit x86 Python distribution is also possible::

    $ ./build-linux.py --target i686-unknown-linux-gnu

As are various other targets::

    $ ./build-linux.py --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
    $ ./build-linux.py --target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabi
    $ ./build-linux.py --target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
    $ ./build-linux.py --target mips-unknown-linux-gnu
    $ ./build-linux.py --target mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu
    $ ./build-linux.py --target ppc64le-unknown-linux-gnu
    $ ./build-linux.py --target s390x-unknown-linux-gnu

macOS
=====

The XCode command line tools must be installed. A Python 3 interpreter
is required to execute the build. ``/usr/bin/clang`` must exist.

macOS SDK headers must be installed. Try running ``xcode-select --install``
to install them if you see errors about e.g. ``stdio.h`` not being found.
Verify they are installed by running ``xcrun --show-sdk-path``. It
should print something like
``/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk``
on modern versions of macOS.

To build a Python distribution for macOS::

    $ ./build-macos.py

macOS uses the same build code as Linux, just without Docker.
So similar build configuration options are available.

``build-macos.py`` accepts a ``--target-triple`` argument to support building
for non-native targets (i.e. cross-compiling). By default, macOS builds target
the currently running architecture. e.g. an Intel Mac will target
``x86_64-apple-darwin`` and an M1 (ARM) Mac will target ``aarch64-apple-darwin``.
It should be possible to build an ARM distribution on an Intel Mac and an Intel
distribution on an ARM Mac.

The ``APPLE_SDK_PATH`` environment variable is recognized as the path
to the Apple SDK to use. If not defined, the build will attempt to find
an SDK by running ``xcrun --show-sdk-path``.

``aarch64-apple-darwin`` builds require a macOS 11.0+ SDK and building
Python 3.9+. It should be possible to build for ``aarch64-apple-darwin`` from
an Intel 10.15 machine (as long as the 11.0+ SDK is used).

Python 3.8 may not build properly with a macOS 11.0+ SDK: try using the
macOS 10.15 SDK instead.

Windows
=======

Visual Studio 2017 (or later) is required. A compatible Windows SDK is required
(10.0.17763.0 as per CPython 3.7.2).

If building CPython 3.8+, there are the following additional requirements:

* A ``git.exe`` on ``PATH`` (to clone ``libffi`` from source).
* An installation of Cywgin with the ``autoconf``, ``automake``, ``libtool``,
  and ``make`` packages installed. (``libffi`` build dependency.)

To build a Python distribution for Windows x64::

   # From a Visual Studio 2017/2019 x64 native tools command prompt:
   $ py.exe build-windows.py --profile static-noopt

It is also possible to build a more traditional dynamically linked
distribution, optionally with PGO optimizations::

   $ py.exe build-windows.py --profile shared-noopt
   $ py.exe build-windows.py --profile shared-pgo

If building CPython 3.8+, you will need to specify the path to a
``sh.exe`` installed from cygwin. e.g.

   $ py.exe build-windows.py --python cpython-3.8 --sh c:\cygwin\bin\sh.exe --profile shared

To build a 32-bit x86 binary, simply use an ``x86 Native Tools
Command Prompt`` instead of ``x64``.

Using sccache to Speed up Builds
================================

Builds can take a long time.

python-build-standalone can automatically detect and use the
`sccache <https://github.com/mozilla/sccache>`_ compiler cache to speed
up subsequent builds on UNIX-like platforms. ``sccache`` can shave dozens
of minutes from fresh builds, even on a 16 core CPU!

If there is an executable ``sccache`` in the source directory, it will
automatically be copied into the build environment and used. For non-container
builds, an ``sccache`` executable is also searched for on ``PATH``.

The ``~/.python-build-standalone-env`` file is read if it exists (the format is
``key=value`` pairs) and variables are added to the build environment.

In addition, environment variables ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID``,
``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``, and any variable beginning with ``SCCACHE_`` are
automatically added to the build environment.

The environment variable support enables you to define remote build caches
(such as S3 buckets) to provide a persistent, shared cache across builds and
machines.

Keep in mind that when performing builds in containers in Linux (the default
behavior), the local filesystem is local to the container and does not survive
the build of a single package. So sccache is practically meaningless unless
configured to use an external store (such as S3).

When using remote stores (such as S3), ``sccache`` can be constrained on
network I/O. We recommend having at least a 100mbps network connection to
a remote store and employing a network store with as little latency as possible
for best results.
